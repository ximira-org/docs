# NOVA Hardware Overview

---
version: 23.3-0
---

NOVA is intended to be open and extensible. However, the Ximira team designs and maintains hardware specifications for our reference implementations. This section is intended to document these designs.

## Core Components

A minimal NOVA system will consist of a compute unit, one or more depth cameras (i.e., perception units), and a bluetooth headset for voice communication. For a complete experience, we recommend the use of one of our haptic feedback peripherals as well as a GPS receiver.

* [Compute Unit (v1)](nova-cu-v1.md)
* [Perception Unit (v1)](nova-pu-v1.md)
* [Haptic Band (v1)](nova-band-v1.md)
* [Haptic Glove (v1)](nova-glove-v1.md)
* [GPS Module(v1)](nova-gps-v1.md)

Ximira also maintains designs for wearable packs that neatly integrate all of the NOVA core components.

* [NOVA-Sling (v1)](nova-sling-v1.md)
