# NOVA Compute Unit (CU)

A NOVA system is managed via a central Compute Unit (CU). This is essentially a compact, portable personal computer -- a laptop without a screen. All sensors adn peripheral devices connect to the CU either using USB-C cables or wirelessly via bluetooth.

## Design Goals

The primary design goals for the CU were as follows:

  - Integrate adequate CPU and GPU processing power
  - Leverage off-the-shelf components where possible
  - Utilize modern standards for connectivity including
    + USB-C 3.2 (at least 2 available ports)
    + Wi-Fi 6
    + Bluetooth 5 + BLE
  - Integrated speakers for notifications & alerts when no headset is attached
  - Low heat and low power consumption
  - Multi-hour battery life with active use
  - Easy to charge with the potential for supplemental, external batteries
  - Optimized cost and value
