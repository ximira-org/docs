NOVA is optimized to work with two haptic interface devices that can communicate information to the wearer via vibrations. This document describes Ximira's reference implementation of a glove-based haptic interface. In addition to 4 vibration motors, it incorporate a 9-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) that can accurately detect position and motion, enabling hand tracking and gesture detection.
